The first convolutional layer filters the 224×224×3 input image with 96 kernels of size 11×11×3
with a stride of 4 pixels (this is the distance between the receptive field centers of neighboring
neurons in a kernel map). 

The second convolutional layer takes as input the (response-normalized
and pooled) output of the first convolutional layer and filters it with 256 kernels of size 5 × 5 × 48.

The third, fourth, and fifth convolutional layers are connected to one another without any intervening
pooling or normalization layers. 


The third convolutional layer has 384 kernels of size 3 × 3 × 256 connected to the (normalized, pooled) 
outputs of the second convolutional layer. 

The fourth convolutional layer has 384 kernels of size 3 × 3 × 192 , 

and the fifth convolutional layer has 256 kernels of size 3 × 3 × 192. 


The fully-connected layers have 4096 neurons each.




Figure 2: An illustration of the architecture of our CNN, explicitly showing the delineation of responsibilities
between the two GPUs. One GPU runs the layer-parts at the top of the figure while the other runs the layer-parts
at the bottom. The GPUs communicate only at certain layers. The network’s input is 150,528-dimensional, and
the number of neurons in the network’s remaining layers is given by 253,440–186,624–64,896–64,896–43,264–
4096–4096–1000.
